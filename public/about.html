<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a Web Developer in training. I was born in San Antonio Texas and adopted at birth to two loving individuals that have given me a fantastic life. One year later those same loving individuals adopted a brother into my life.  I was raised a Catholic and went to Saints Phillip and James elementary school where I learned most of my morales and values. My mother taught me how to have faith at that age and my father tried teaching me the ways of the dollar at that age. I was signed up for almost every sport whether I liked it or not. I like to think I played everything with good heart, but I fell in love with baseball. My brother and I played T-ball and baseball all throughout Elementary school.</p>

<p>I left Catholic school at middle school and that's where the fun began. My brother learned to smoke and I tried my best to stay the good child. I became friends with who would be my lifelong friend Jared, and little did I know at the time that we would get into all sorts of trouble together, for better or worse. It was at this age I distanced myself from my parents and started to feel that adoptive disconnect (feelings that I would forever despise). I felt a connection with my brother (because he was biological) that I would never feel with my parents. It was at this time that I discovered my ADHD and was put on the medication that would almost ruin my life and kill me.</p>

<p>My high school years were a blur. It was here I learned to love alcohol (from my brother), and partying. To avoid making this project take too long I'm going to summarize the rest by saying I drank and drugged myself into oblivion, got arrested twice, lost everything, and then finally turned my life around to make something of myself. I worked my ass off and became a manager and partial owner of the company I work for and am shooting for full ownership and bought a house and am now getting married!</p>
